# Code bits {.unnumbered}


[Here](https://github.com/colinbousige/rclass/tree/main/code_bits) I provide various code bits that I wrote for fun or for learning some aspects. It's here for you if you are interested:

- [2D Gaussian fits](https://github.com/colinbousige/rclass/tree/main/code_bits/fit_2d_gaussian): a colleague coming from Matlab wanted to be able to fit 2D Gaussians from Raman mappings. It's actually not too hard with `nls()`{.R} and a tidy `tibble`. The only thing is that the initial guess of peaks positions needs to be not very far from the actual peaks positions â€“ you can either provide it by hand or make an automatic peak finder. 
- [Fractals](https://github.com/colinbousige/rclass/tree/main/code_bits/fractal): I played around with the Mandelbrot set to make fractals, and compared a full-R code to a code using `Rcpp` (it was for me the occasion of my first code using `Rcpp`)... `Rcpp` wins (largely!) in terms of speed here! And it makes for suuuuuper nice images, too. I got inspiration from a [R-bloggers post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/06/the-mandelbrot-set-in-r-2/).

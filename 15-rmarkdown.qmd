# Writing documents with Rmarkdown

## What is markdown?

Markdown is a simplified language that can be used to produce a variety of rich documents: a single .md file can be compiled and outputted to .docx, .odt, .html, .rtf, .pdf or .tex. This output format as well as various options (font size, template, table of contents, numbered sections...) are specified in a YAML header, *i.e.* text between two lines like that `---` (we'll see an example later).

In markdown can be embedded $\LaTeX$ code for displaying math expressions, html tags for more complicated html stuff, and the rest of the formatting is given by a few easy commands:

```markdown
# Title
## sub-title
### sub-sub-title
...
###### sub_6-title
**bold**
*italic*
[link](http://google.com/)
![image caption](image.png)

Table:
|   |   |
|---|---|
|   |   |

Unordered list:
- bla
- bla bla

Ordered list:
1. bla
1. bla bla

LaTeX code: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2}=\sqrt{\pi}$

HTML code: <a href="some_link">text</a>
```

You can also add in-line code by writing text between back-ticks:
```markdown
Text with `in-line code`
```
will render as: Text with `in-line code`

For more commands, you can for example get a digested cheat-sheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and a tutorial [here](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

## ... and Rmarkdown?

Rmarkdown is basically the same thing as markdown (extension: .Rmd instead of .md), with the difference that code chunks in which you specify the language between accolades *will be computed and the result will be displayed*.

````r
```r
# Not computed
1+1
```
````

````r
`r ''````{r}
# Computed
1+1
```
````
```{r, echo=FALSE}
1+1
```

And in-line code can be computed and rendered:
```markdown
In-line code ``r ''`r 1+2`
```
will render as: In-line code `r 1+2`.

This very webpage is fully written in Rmarkdown (see the "View book source" at the bottom of the left sidebar).

Rmarkdown supports a number of languages:
```{r}
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())
```

And `python` and `R` code chunks can communicate thanks to the `reticulate` package.

So... are you starting to see the power of this tool...?

Basically, you can use the best language for each task and combine it in a single Rmd file that will display text and images that are computed at each compilation of the Rmd file: you can fully automatize your data treatment and reporting. 

Example:

- chunk 1: bash, call a program that creates some files
- chunk 2: python, call a program that do some big computation on these files
- chunk 3: R, do some data treatment, plot the data

## Example {#example-Rmd}

Download <a href="Data/biblio.bib" target="_blank" download>biblio.bib</a> and <a href="Data/nature.csl" target="_blank" download>nature.csl</a> and put them at the root of your project.

Create an _example.Rmd_ file with the following YAML header (**the indentation is important**):

```yaml
---
title  : Your Title
author : John Doe
date   : ``r ''`r format(Sys.time(), '%d/%m/%Y')`
output :
    html_document:
        toc            : true
        toc_float      : true
        highlight      : tango
        number_sections: false
        code_folding   : hide    
bibliography: "biblio.bib"
csl         : "nature.csl"
---
```
How to understand this header:

- `---`: surrounds the YAML header. The body comes after that.
- `title`, `author` and `date`: easy. The date can automatically be set to the current one by setting it to:
```
``r ''`r format(Sys.time(), '%d/%m/%Y')`
```
- `output`: this tells pandoc the output format you want. When compiling, in case there are multiple entries, the compiler will only look to the _**first**_ one. Click the links below to see more options.
    + In this case, the output will be an [html document](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) with a floating table of contents, unnumbered sections and all code chunks will be hidden with a button to allow showing them.
    + [Other output formats allowed](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html):
        * [`word_document`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/word-document.html)
        * [`pdf_document`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html)
        * [`rtf_document`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rich-text-format-document.html)
        * [`beamer_presentation`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/beamer-presentation.html)
        * ...
    + Useful options: 
        + Word document: you can supply a reference style (template) to use. Just write a dummy .docx file in which you [edit the style](http://www.dummies.com/software/microsoft-office/word/how-to-change-an-existing-style-in-word-2016/), save it as `word-template.docx` (for example), and set the option `reference_docx: word-template.docx`.
        + LaTeX: `keep_tex`: when pandoc compiles your markdown file to a PDF, it goes through the intermediate step of creating a .tex file. You can decide to keep it for tweaking the style of the PDF output, like you would normally do with a .tex file.
        + `fig_caption`: allows for figure caption.
        + `toc`: creates a table of contents.
        + `number_sections`: allows for section numbering.
        + `highlight`: syntax highlighting theme for the code chunks.
- `bibliography`: path to your .bib file. To create a bibliography, add a ```# References``` header at the end of your document.
- `csl`: path to the bibliography style for the output -- in this example, _nature.csl_. [Find your style](https://www.zotero.org/styles) or edit your own. 
- There are many [other options](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf), but with this you'll fulfill most of your needs.


Now you can start adding some content, like:
````markdown
---
title: "The title"
output: 
    bookdown::html_document2: #instead of html_document, for referencing images
        toc            : true
        toc_float      : true
        highlight      : tango
        number_sections: true
        code_folding   : show
        code_download  : true
    # bookdown::pdf_document2 #instead of pdf_document, for referencing images
bibliography: "biblio.bib"
csl         : "nature.csl"
---

# First section
## First subsection
I am writing _italic_ and __bold__ stuff.

- This is an item
- Another one with citations [@bevan_statistical_2013;@rcoreteam_language_2017]

# Second section
## First subsection that I want to refer to {#subsectionID}

This is a text with a footnote[^1].

Now I can refer to my subsection using `\@ref(subsectionID)` like so:
section \@ref(subsectionID).

This is an image with a caption:

`r ''````{r CHUNKname, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This is a very nice caption", out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://cdn.foliovision.com/images/2017/03/i-love-markdown.png")
```

And I can refer to this figure using `\@ref(fig:CHUNKname)`. 
Example : Figure \@ref(fig:CHUNKname).

Here is a code chunk in R in Fig. \@ref(fig:Rfigure):
`r ''````{r Rfigure, fig.cap="Test figure in R", fig.align='center'}
x <- seq(0,10,.1)
plot(x, sin(x), main="R plot")
```

And one in python in Fig. \@ref(fig:Pythonfigure):
`r ''````{python Pythonfigure, fig.cap="Test figure in python", fig.align='center'}
# Load some libraries
import numpy as np
# Matplotlib non interactive plots
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
N = 100
x = np.linspace(0,10,N)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.title("Matplotlib Plot")
plt.ylabel("Y values")
plt.xlabel("X values")
plt.show()
```

```` 

Note that when you choose to output to an html format, you can't use PDF images: use .svg ([pdf2svg](http://www.cityinthesky.co.uk/opensource/pdf2svg/)) or other non vectorial images. 

What's nice with html output, it's that you can include _interactive_ figures with `plotly` like we saw in the previous sections. Of course, this won't work with static documents like PDF or Word...

For cross referencing to figures and tables, use `output: bookdown::html_document2` instead of `output: html_document` (requires the package `bookdown`), and see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cross-ref.html) for details.


## Code chunks options

You can add options to a code chunk, like:

- `echo=FALSE`: hide the code, show the output
- `include=FALSE`: hide the code and the output
- `warnings=FALSE`: hide the warning messages
- `error=TRUE`: will compute the code chunk despite errors
- `cache=TRUE`: cache the result of the chunk for faster re-compilation
- `fig.asp`: figure aspect ratio
- `fig.caption`: figure caption
- ...[and more](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/)

## Compilation

To knit your Rmd file to the desired output, in Rstudio, click the little triangle next to the "Knit" button, like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Plots/compile_rmd.png")
```

The corresponding output file will be created in the same folder.

## Going further: parameters

You can even provide a list of parameters to your Rmarkdown file that you can retrieve in code chunks with `params$param_name`. More information [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html), but here is a short example: try compiling it directly using the "Knit" button, and then try compiling it using "Knit with parameters". Alternatively, you can have the popup interactive window by rendering with the command `rmarkdown::render("MyDocument.Rmd", params = "ask")`.


````markdown
---
title: "Test"
output: html_document
params:
  city:
    label: "City:"
    value: Angers
    input: select
    multiple: TRUE
    choices: [Angers, Paris, Montpellier, Nantes, Marseille]
  printcode:
    label: "Display Code"
    value: TRUE
  data:
    label: "Input dataset:"
    value: "Data/population.txt"
    input: file
---

`r ''````{r, setup, include=FALSE}
# set this option in the first code chunk in the document
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = params$printcode)
```

Plotting ``r ''`r paste(params$data)`:

`r ''````{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
df <- read.table(params$data, header=TRUE)
p <- ggplot(data=subset(df, city %in% params$city), 
            aes(x=year, y=pop, size=pop, color=city)) +
        geom_point() + 
        geom_smooth(method="lm", aes(fill=city), alpha=0.1, show.legend = FALSE) + 
        ggtitle(paste("Population in ",paste(params$city, collapse=", "),sep=""))+
        labs(x="Year", y="Population")+
        theme_light()
ggplotly(p)
```
````


The "Knit with parameters" launches a `Shiny` user interface allowing interactively choosing the parameters. All options are listed [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/params-knit.html#the-interactive-user-interface).



## And what about JuPyteR notebooks?

[JuPyteR notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are basically a web-based interactive version or Rmarkdown documents working with **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon and **R**. 

But the installation is a tad complicated for the non initiate, and, well, it is just like Rmarkdown but less easy to use and share, in my opinion. But if you mostly work with python, then you have to get used to it since Rmarkdown is better suited for R.


## Welcome to the future: Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a standalone project from the Rstudio team built on [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) that lookis a lot like Rmarkdown, but tailored not only for R but also for python, julia and observable.

All your `Rmd` files should be directly compatible with quarto upon changing the extension name to `qmd`. Then I invite you to explore the [new possibilities offerd by quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/).

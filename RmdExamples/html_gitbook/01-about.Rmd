# About the class


## Objectives of the class

The goal of this class is that at the end, the students are able to:

- Treat their data with the **free** and **open source** language **[R](https://www.r-project.org/)**, *i.e.*:
    + Read, browse, manipulate and plot their data
    + Model or simulate their data
- Make automatic reporting through **[Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)**
- Build a graphical interface with **[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)** to interact with their data and output something (a value, a pdf report, a graph...)

What you will learn here will be useful in **any** scientific domain. The examples in this course are however mainly coming from the type of data you might encounter in Materials Science because, well, it's what I have on hand...

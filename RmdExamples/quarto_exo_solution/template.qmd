```{python}
#| tags: [parameters]
#| include: false
alpha = 0.1
```

```{python}
#| include: false
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
np.random.seed(0)
```

## Exercise 1

Here is a distribution of width $\alpha=$ `{python} alpha` defined with `python`. Now do your stuff.

```{python}
distribution = np.random.normal(0, alpha, 10)
print(distribution)
```


::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solution

Here is the solution with some maths : $\alpha=$ `{python} alpha`, and some code and graphs:

```{python}
plt.hist(distribution)
plt.show()
```

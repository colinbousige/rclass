I recently saw this graph I thought it would be a good exercise to try and reproduce a similar graph from online-available data (graph source: [J.-M. Jancovici](https://www.facebook.com/jeanmarc.jancovici/photos/a.153593767280/10158534453647281/?type=3)):

Of course, it would be too easy if we could find the actual data in the correct format...

Here, we will try reproducing the following graphs from <a href="Data/CO2_emission.csv" download target="_blank">CO2_emission.csv</a>, <a href="Data/energy-use-per-capita.csv" download target="_blank">energy-use-per-capita.csv</a>, <a href="Data/country-and-continent.csv" download target="_blank">country-and-continent.csv</a> and <a href="Data/tot_population.csv" download target="_blank">tot_population.csv</a> (sources: [CO2](https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&series=EN.ATM.CO2E.PC&country=#), [Energy](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources#per-capita-electricity-consumption), [Population](https://github.com/datasets/population/blob/master/data/population.csv), [countries and continents](https://datahub.io/JohnSnowLabs/country-and-continent-codes-list)).

You can get help on dataset merging [here](https://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/data_wrangling).

# Data wrangling

- Load the different datasets in tibbles named `CO2`, `continent`, `pop` and `energy`
    + In the case of `continent`, we care only about the 1st and 5th columns, respectively "Continent", and "Code"

```{r}

```

- Make sure all tibbles are tidy, and that the column types (double, character...) are set correctly.

```{r}

```

- Merge all tibbles into a single one using `inner_join`

```{r}

```

- We are only interested in the columns 'Code', 'Year', 'CO2', 'Continent', 'Energy', 'Country' and 'Population'. This tibble should look like the tibble printed below

```{r}

```

- Create a vector of the countries you are interested in (e.g. EU...)

```{r}

```

- Create a tibble `ave` containing the averaged CO2 emission, Energy consumption and Population for each country of this group of countries

```{r}

```



# Plotting

- Try reproducing the following plots. The following graphs are for countries within the EU (as of 2019). Make it for the continent of your origin.
    + Don't bother with the text labels first
    + Try adding them using the library `ggrepel`

```{r}

```
